-- Response detection for only the current epoch._/
-- Implement MEP_Classifier _/
-- MEP Classification for the entire dataset at a go. _/
-- Ability to stop the whole dataset MEP classification midway. [use ctrl+alt+del _/]  
-- [NOT URGENT]Ability to select MEP classifier to be used. Ref:#jj. _/
-- [NOT URGENT AT ALL]Ability to select MEP classifier settings,e.g,mepamplitude threshold, min_width. COuld be combined with #jj
-- Ability to decide to detect features for this epoch or for all epochs._/
-- Describe threshold based respons detector as this will be compared to the classifier(is it combination of presence and response width ?)._/
