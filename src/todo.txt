    % 1. [DONE]Display continouse data
    % 2. [DONE]Apply filtering only to continuous data
    % 2.1. [DONE]merge multiple continouse dataset
    % 2.2. [DONE]Add a button to epoch continuos data and open it in epoch lab.
    % 3. Export continouse data to EEGLAB
    % 4. Export epoched data to EEGLAB.
    % 4.1. Merge multiple epoched datasets
    % 5. [DONE]Automatic EP onset point detection
    % 6. [DONE]Manual definition of EP start and stop points (this should be used when available instead of auto detected points)
    % 7. [DONE]Entry of EP window for offline (i.e equivalent to the viewer EP window used online)
    % 8. [DONE]Computation of EP characteristics - peak2peak, area and unset time. saved in features.response per epoch
    % 9. [DONE]Computation of average and recruitment curve using data from #8
    % 10. Determine the lowest stimulation instensity and find the
    % associated channel: e.g we could determine lowest intensity
    % thus:a=rand(6,12);findchangepts(a). And then find a channel with the
    % the least RMT.
    % 11. Normalise the response peak2peak and area using m-max.
    % 12. Implement STUDY to allow multiple data sets to be compared with respect the the variables computed in 8# and #9.

2. % TODO: 
    % [DONE @see 'Definitions' in manuscript]1. Define the criteria for detecting change points that forms the
    % threshold for stimulation: ANS: The stimulation threshold will be
    % defined as the intensity where recruitment curve has the first major
    % increase. In the current case(with trials without response set to
    % nan/zero) it is the intensity that leads to the first evoked response.
    % 2.[DONE] Auto detect the presence of EP and mark the presence on
    %   EPR.epochs.features.response.auto_presence:
      2.2. [DONE]Change the EPR.epochs.features.response.presence to ...maunal_presence.
      2.3. [DONE created a has() method instead]Create a static method eprecorder_response.getEffectivePresence() which returns maunal_presence??auto_presence.
    % 3. [DONE]Import arbitrary continous data from matlab workspace.
    4. Analyse patient data and present results of Stimulation threshold 
        and spinal level for each channel and all channels together.
    5. Convert the Single pulse RMT to equivalent threshold for continouse 
        high frequency stimulation. The converted value should be used 
        presenting the data to clinicians e.g see eprecorder_response_change_point.stimulusRestingMotorThreshod

3: 1. Rename the package to 'Response'.
